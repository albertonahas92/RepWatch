                <p>1. What information do we collect?</p>

                <p>
                    When registering on our site, rating photos, or testing
                    photos, as appropriate, we collect information from you in
                    order to provide and improve upon our service. It&apos;s
                    apparent, first of all, that you can post images to
                    Photofeeler.
                </p>

                <p>We also may collect your:</p>

                <p>
                    First name Email address Birth date or birth year Gender
                    Additionally, if you register using Facebook or LinkedIn,
                    you may be asked for further information specific to your
                    Facebook or LinkedIn account. (Typically this will include
                    your public profile information.) It is Facebook and
                    LinkedIn&apos;s responsibility that a list of this
                    information be shown to you, so that you can accept or deny
                    those requests at the time of registration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may optionally provide us with occupation-related
                    information when adding a context label to Business images
                    in which you are the photo subject.
                </p>

                <p>2. What do we use your information for?</p>

                <p>
                    We collect your email address in order to send periodic
                    emails, to contact you in regards to your Photofeeler
                    account, and to identify your account. Do note that you may
                    unsubcribe from our periodic emails at any time, using the
                    link at the bottom of any email you&apos;ve received from
                    us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We collect your first name, gender, and birth date or year
                    in order to customize your experience, ensure that the
                    correct photos are shown to the correct users, and to
                    conduct research.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you optionally choose to label a Business photo of
                    yourself with a description of what you do for work,
                    Photofeeler provides this context to targeted users so that
                    they may rate photos more accurately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Any actions performed on Photofeeler are collected and
                    retained as a core function of providing and maintaining our
                    service and may be used without identifying information in
                    scientific research.
                </p>

                    4. We do not disclose any information to outside parties
                    except as per your request.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Except in the case of a merger or acquisition, your
                    information, whether public or private, will not be sold,
                    exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for
                    any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for
                    the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or
                    service requested.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in
                    operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing
                    you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information
                    confidential. We may also release your information when we
                    believe release is appropriate to comply with the law,
                    enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights,
                    property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable
                    visitor information may be provided to other parties for
                    marketing, advertising, or other uses.
                </p>

                <p>5. How we protect your information</p>

                <p>
                    We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the
                    safety of your personal information when you submit or
                    access your personal information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied
                    sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure
                    Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our
                    payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by
                    those authorized with special access rights to such systems,
                    and are required to keep the information confidential.
